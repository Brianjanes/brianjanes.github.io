  <div class="mb-10 text-justify">
    I'm a dedicated professional with a background in culinary arts and a
    passion for web development. With a decade in the culinary world, I've
    mastered organization, time management, and effective communication.
    Transitioning to web development, I'm proficient in technologies like React
    and Node, driven by a commitment to innovation and collaboration. My unique
    blend of skills, from leadership to technical prowess, equips me to create
    impactful solutions that positively impact lives. I'm excited to contribute
    my expertise to projects that matter and promote positive change within the
    tech community. When I'm not coding or surfing the web, I'm an avid Magic:
    the Gathering player, mediocre powerlifter, DIY home renovation enthusiast,
    and father of two lovely dogs who need a lot of exercise.
